# Renewable energy in the European Union


## Business Problem 
<p align="justify"> Renewable energy plays an important and growing role in the energy system of the European Union. Renewable energy resources (RER) are seen as option to reduce EU's energy dependence on imported energy and provide social and environmental benefits. In 2009 the Renewables Directive set binding targets for all EU Member States, such that the EU will reach a 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a 10% share of renewable energy specifically in the transport. Maintaining an overview of the current state of the renewable energies' performances in the European Union is crucial for making informed decisionsâ€”ranging from policy and investment decisions to reliable power sector planning. Decisions that are data-driven reflect appropriate ambition, maximize cost- effectiveness, and enable successful implementation of renewable energy investments. </p>

## Project Objective 
1. Analysis of the total energy production from renewable sources.
2. Analysis of the wind and solar production in the european countries.

The following goals are addressed in this notebook:

* Inspect the dataset
* Check data types and do meaningful modifications
* Handle missings/data gaps
* Find and solve data inconsistencies
* Rename columns for improved usage
* Join tables to a single one
* Data Visualisation with seaborn and geopandas

Furthermore, the data is investigated at a very high level for illustrative purposes. Here, correlations between different features are examined.


## Technologies

* Python 3
* Jupyther notebook 
* seaborn, matplotlib: Visualization libraries
* geopandas: for geographic data
* geoplot:  used for geospatial visualizations
* numpy: Array operations and useful analysis functionalities
* pandas: data handling library

## Sources
