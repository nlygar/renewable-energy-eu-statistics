# Renewable energy in the European Union¶


## Business Problem 
<p align="justify"> Renewable energy plays an important and growing role in the energy system of the European Union. Renewable energy resources (RER) are seen as option to reduce EU's energy dependence on imported energy and provide social and environmental benefits. In 2009 the Renewables Directive set binding targets for all EU Member States, such that the EU will reach a 20% share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a 10% share of renewable energy specifically in the transport. Maintaining an overview of the current state of the renewable energies' performances in the European Union is crucial for making informed decisions—ranging from policy and investment decisions to reliable power sector planning. Decisions that are data-driven reflect appropriate ambition, maximize cost- effectiveness, and enable successful implementation of renewable energy investments. </p>

## Project Objective 

This project will explore recommendation algorithms with a goal of developing a system that is both accurate and feasible to implement.
